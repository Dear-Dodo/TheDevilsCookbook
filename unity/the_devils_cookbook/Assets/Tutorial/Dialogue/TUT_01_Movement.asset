    Text: And what kind of boss would I be if I didn't give you a little on-the-job
      training? How about you head over into the other room, and I can show you the

    Text: Use WASD to move and SHIFT to dash. You can dash through certain objects
      and over small gaps. Your dash recharges but can only hold <b>two charges at
      a time,</b> so use them wisely.
