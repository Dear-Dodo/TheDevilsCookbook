Welcome to The Devil's Cookbook's <color=#00b3ff><b>b0.2</b></color> play test!

b0.2 is the second version of beta, and is intended for internal testing. This is not a development build, and errors will be hidden.
If you encounter an error, press ` to open the debug console and read it, it will also be in the log file.
<b>Known Issues</b>
Levels:
    - Level 1 & 2 lack functional minimaps
	- Tutorial does not work (its being replaced)

Spells:
    - Trap spell cast validity not clear (Casting out of range does nothing)
    - Spellcasting is possible while in the radial menu
    - Death does not stop spell cast selection

Animation:
    - Damage from patron's biting is not synced properly with the animation
    - Patrons may disappear before finishing their animation after being served

UI:
    - Radial menu background can get stuck onscreen if radial menu is closed too quickly after opening
    - The tutorial prompts are irritating and easy to forget (It's on the list!)

Environment:
    - Some internal furniture can be walked through (Hopefully you can't get out of the level!)

Many suggested quality of life features are planned for implementation in future.
