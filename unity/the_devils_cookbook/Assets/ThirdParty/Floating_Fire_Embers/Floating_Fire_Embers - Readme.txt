A cloud of Float Fire Embers to add atmosphere to your environment.

The burning ember particles have animated textures as they randomly float through the scene, and a spread of wind zones are positioned to randomly swirl and tumble the particles.

When the particles come to the end of their life span, or upon colliding with the environment, they disappear in a puff of smoke (a version without collision detection is also included).

Simply load the example Floating_Fire_Embers.unity scene, or drag the Floating_Fire_Embers.prefab from the Prefabs folder into the Hierarchy window.

To tweak the effect settings then select it in the Hierarchy window and the particle parameters will be available to you in the Inspector window (on the right). The effect scale can be altered by changing the shape of the Box under the "Shape" settings. Note that to keep the particle density the same you'll want to alter the Rate (under "Emission") to keep in at the same ratio, ie if you double the width of the box then also double the particle count.

Have fun!
